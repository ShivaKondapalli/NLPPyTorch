# Natural Language processing tasks

## Introduction 

An exploration of various NLP tasks with Pytorch code. The best way to learn is by doing. This repository consists of: 

## **1. RNN Classification: RNNClassification.py**

Created and Compared two recurrent Neural Networks: a *plain vanilla* reccurent neural network and a *Gated Recurrent Unit* on classyfying
the nationality of Individuals based on their names. 

Created a *Square Confusion Matrix* of the original nationalites and the predicted ones from the model.
The Gated Recurrent unit does much better.
